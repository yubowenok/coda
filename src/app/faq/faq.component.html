  <h2>How to Solve a Problem</h2>
  <h3><a href="#inout" id="inout"></a>Input and Output</h3>
  Your solutions programs are always checked by a judge machine instead of a human.
  The machine runs your program with additional secret test data in addition to the sample inputs,
  and checks if your program's output matches exactly the correct answer.
  There are a few important things to keep in mind:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Your must always read from standard input (stdin in C++ and System.in in Java).
      You shall never read from a file, or pass the data as arguments of the main function.
    </li>
    <li>
      You must always output to standard output (stdout in C++ and System.out in Java).
      You shall not output to a file.
    </li>
    <li>
      Your output must be exactly the same as the correct answer, without any extra characters.
      You must remove any debugging printing or logs at stdout before submitting your program.
      stderr printing is allowed, but do not print excessively as I/O significantly slows down your program.
    </li>
  </ul>
  Below are some template I/O code for C++ and Java.

  <h2>Problemset Modes</h2>
  <h3><a href="#standard" id="standard"></a>Standard Problemset</h3>
  <p>
    You can submit anytime before the problemset ends.
  </p>
  <h3><a href="#selftest" id="selftest"></a>Selftest Problemset</h3>
  <p>
    The problemset has a fixed duration. You can start your session at any time.
    But once your session is started you cannot pause it.
    Only start your session when you have enough time as long as the problemset's duration.
  </p>
  <h3><a href="#open" id="open"></a>Open Judge</h3>
  <p>
    Submission results are available right after the submissions.
  </p>
  <h3><a href="#blind" id="blind"></a>Blind Judge</h3>
  <p>
    Submission results will be available after the problemset ends.
    Scoreboard will show your maximum possible score before the problemset ends (i.e. assuming all your submissions
    are correct).
  </p>
  <h3><a href="#score-penalty" id="score-penalty"></a>Score Penalty</h3>
  <p>
    Each incorrect submission results in 10% loss of a subtask's score.
    You will get a minimum of 30% score if you solve the subtask in the end.
  </p>
  <h3><a href="#time-penalty" id="time-penalty"></a>Time Penalty</h3>
  <p>
    Each incorrect submission results in 4 minutes extra time added to the problemset finish time.
  </p>
  <h3><a href="#freebies" id="freebies"></a>Freebies</h3>
  <p>
    This is the number of incorrect submissions that are exempted from penalty.
    Each problem subtask has its own freebies.
