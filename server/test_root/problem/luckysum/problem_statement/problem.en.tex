The lottery company has just launched a new game!
Each lottery ticket now consists of $N$ integers.
Every week the lottery draws a single lucky sum $S$.
The payout of a ticket is the number of integer pairs on the ticket that have a sum of $S$.
To have a better understanding of your chance of winning, you would like to determine the payouts for $Q$ lucky sums.

\section*{Input}

The first line of the input has an integer $T$, the number of test cases.\\
Each case has two integer $N, Q$ on the first line.\\
The next line has $N$ integers, the integers on the lottery ticket.
Note that the lottery ticket integers may have duplicates.
Then follow $Q$ lines, each has a single integer representing one lucky sum for which you are going to determine the payout.

\section*{Output}
For each lucky sum, output the payout on a single line.

\section*{Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
\item $1 \leq T\leq 15$
\item $2 \leq N \leq 1\,000$
\item $1 \leq Q \leq 5\,000$
\item Integers on the lottery ticket and the lucky sums are non-negative and no larger than $10^6$.
\item The lucky sums in each test case are distinct.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Subtasks}
\begin{itemize}
\item (Small - 10 points): $N, Q \leq 50$
\item (Large - 25 points): Original constraints
\end{itemize}
