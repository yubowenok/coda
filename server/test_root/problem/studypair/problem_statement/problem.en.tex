\problemname{Study Pair}

There are two classes, class $A$ and class $B$.
Each class has $N$ students.
The teacher wants to make study pairs between the two classes.
Each study pair consists of one student from class $A$ and the other from class $B$.
Every student's knowledge level on the course topic can be described as an integer.
Namely, the $i$-th student from class $A$ has knowledge level $A_i$, and the $i$-th student from class $B$ has knowledge level $B_i$.
To achieve best study results, the knowledge levels of the two students in a study pair shall not differ too much.
Besides, the sum of the knowledge levels of the two students in a pair shall not be too large (Let strong students help the others!).
More formally, given two constants $X, Y$, for every study pair $(A_i, B_j)$, it must satisfy $|A_i - B_j| \leq X$ and $A_i + B_j \leq Y$.


The teacher wonders what is the maximum number of study pairs she can make?


\section*{Input}

The first line of the input has an integer $T$, the number of test cases.\\
Each case has three lines.
The first line has three integers $N, X, Y$.
The second line has $N$ integers, $A_1, A_2, ... A_N$.
The third line has $N$ integers, $B_1, B_2, ... B_N$.

\section*{Output}

For each case, output the maximum number of study pairs that can be made.
